## Why?

Creating pop-up components is a repetitive and time-consuming task. Each time you reuse such components, you need to redefine common fields like reject, resolve, and visible. Additionally, controlling this process (`clear data`->`open Model`->`edit data`->`onConfirm`->`save data`) can lead to a lot of redundant code, especially for some global components.

Overlastic simplifies the creation of pop-up components by reducing redundant processes and managing the corresponding state. It effectively creates imperative components while also supporting declarative usage.
